## UFO Sightings Webpage Project

### Overview of Project: 
Dana, a data analyst, is going to publish an article on UFO sightings in her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon. She's asked us for our help in creating a dynamic webpage to sort through data of UFO sightings and present articles. We used JavaScript to create filters and display the article.
### Results: 
The webpage is designed to display the title, the article, and the filter to look at specific UFO sightings across the US. The filter allows you to filter the results based on the search criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape. The webpage automatically updates after the user types in each input.
### Summary: 
The overall website works and has a unique style. To make it cleaner and more expand on this topic, it would be helpful to center the title of the webpage and also include the details about the webpage. This way, if someone came across the website, they would understand its purpose.

Additionally, the filter can become more user-friendly by including a search button and displaying the number of articles that were returned from the search.
